# Diamond Boot
## Minecraft Server Management System

### Summary
Diamond Boot is a web-based Minecraft server management system designed to provide the a flexible and user friendly experience that is approachable enough for the average Minecraft player, detailed enough for the average Minecraft administrator, and extensible enough for the average Minecraft developer.

### Objectives
* Ready to go - Minimally must be at least as easy to launch as the default server.  This means that with a single double click it must launch a fully functional Minecraft server of the latest version with no adverse effects.
* Web accessible - Available - but secure - from any internet connected device at any time.
* Portable - Run the server on any Java capable platform.
* First rate user experience - This must feel like a tool for server administrators.  The interface must be intuitive for a typically Minecraft player and adhere to high standards of accessibility and usability.
* “Vanilla” baseline - The default Minecraft server launched must be truly vanilla, as delivered by Mojang.  Other non-vanilla servers can be supported but support of vanilla will always take priority.
* Extensible - The ability for developers to write their own extensions must be well documented and highly evident.
